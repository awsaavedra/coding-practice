# Coding Loop

1. Frame the objective
2. Decompose the tasks
3. Start the conversation
4. Review with care
5. Test amd verify
6. Refine and iterate
7. Automate your own workflow

# Key practices to remember as you start cooking: 

1. **Embrace the conversation:** Treat AI interactions like texting with a knowledgeable colleague, not drafting legal documents.
2. **Let errors speak for themselves:** Copy/paste error messages directly rather than explaining what went wrong.
3. **Lean into AI's encyclopedic knowledge:** Don't waste time learning arcane tools when AI already knows them.
4. **Choose the right tool for the job:** Start with agents when possible, gracefully degrade to chat when needed, and always keep your escape hatches open.
5. **Be vague about style, precise about goals:** AI handles implementation details best when you're clear about what you want to accomplish.
6. **Give your AI access to tools:** The magic happens when AI can see, execute, and validate its own work.


# Tools to try

1. Clipboard manager e.g. CopyQ, Alfred for Mac, etc.

2. Dictation tool for coding e.g. SuperWhisper for MacOS
