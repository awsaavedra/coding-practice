We consider three cases:
- If the target equals data[mid], then we have found the item we are looking
for, and the search terminates successfully.

- If target < data[mid], then we recur on the first half of the sequence, that is,
on the interval of indices from low to mid − 1.

- If target > data[mid], then we recur on the second half of the sequence, that
is, on the interval of indices from mid + 1 to high.
